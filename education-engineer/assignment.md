This is a technical writing and editing project as part of your interview.

This project is designed to take between 1.5 - 2 hours.

## Instructions

Before you start editing, you should set up a working environment and learn about our editing process.

Create a git repository on GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or any other git hosting service. 

Read the style guide snippets, which is a subset of our official engineering style guide, and the guide template. Then make improvements to the sample prose so it embodies the principles in the style guide. 

### Get started

Clone the project to your local workstation and navigate to the `education-engineer/` folder. The writing assignment revolves around the file `terraform-getting-started.md` and the edits you will make to this file.

 Alternatively, download the `terraform-getting-started.md` file. You can download the entire project as as zip or by clicking the "Raw" button when viewing the individual file so that you can copy and paste the content. Before editing, commit the inital `terraform-getting-started.md` file to the repo that you have created for this project. 

For this project, you will submit your changes as a pull request. If you are not familiar with the pull request process, review the documenation for [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request), [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.html), or [Bitbucket](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/create-a-pull-request-to-merge-your-change/). Create a new branch where you will make your changes to the sample. 

### Edit the sample

Now that your environment is set up, you can start to edit the sample on your local machine. Complete the following tasks, make all changes in Markdown.

- Look for and fix any spelling or grammar issues.
- Edit the text for readability and compatibility with the style guide.
- Add the outputs in Markdown for all the commands. 
- Add section titles that are compatible with the guide template.
- Add learning objectives to the introduction.
- Add additional sections and content for both prerequisites and next steps. 

### Assumptions: 
- The audience has no to minimal experience with Terraform.

### Submit your sample

- Commit your changes to the `terraform-getting-started.md` file and push to the repository.
- Open a pull request. 
- Send the pull request link to your recruiting contact for review. It will be easiest if this is a public repository.
